<div class="title">combineLatestAll</div>
<div class="info">Using 3 given lists create 3 observables using from() as following:</div>
<div class="info">movies$ with delay 3500, and log a message that movies$ has completed</div>
<div class="info">books$ with delay 2000, and log a message that books$ has completed</div>
<div class="info">songs$ with delay 1000, and log a message that songs$ has completed</div>
<div class="info">create observable using these 3 newly created with of() operator </div>
<div class="info">To have the final data of this array of observables we want to use combineLatestAll to</div>
<div class="info">subscrive to all three observables in a way that when all 3 has completed, we have the final data</div>
<div class="info">and finally we want to log each type of lists separately.</div>
<div class="info">Note that we have created 3 observables and then another observable that is array of those 3</div>
<div class="info">check how combineLatestAll waits for all three and then emits the result</div>
<div class="info">we will see the latest value of the first observable which completes then with each emission from others</div>
<div class="info">we will have new emit of updates state of all observables</div>
