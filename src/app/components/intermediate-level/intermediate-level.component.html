  To demonstrate bufferCount() functionality we will create 3 observables as

</div>
<div class="info">
  interval of 200 which will pipe into bufferCount to buffer 3 emits and takes 4
  buffers
</div>
<div class="info">and finally logs the observable has been completed</div>
<div class="info">
  the 2nd observable will have same structure only buffering 5 and
  startBufferEvery of 3
</div>
<div class="info">
  the 3rd observable will have same structure only buffering 3 and
  startBufferEvery of 5
</div>
<div class="info">
  then we want to executed each observable after the previous one is completed

  Note how parameters will affect on the output (overlap and gap)
