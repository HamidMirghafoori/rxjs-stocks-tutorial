<div class="info">
  To understand the windowToggle functionality we modify bufferToggle code as
  following:
</div>
<div class="info">source$, toggle$, and openings$ are the same</div>
<div class="info">
  In source$ observable subscription we replace bufferToggle with windowToggle
</div>
<div class="info">
  Same as all previous window observables we have to get the values from window$
  observables to log them.
</div>
<div class="info">
  By subscribing to source$ you should see logs of source$ and when you first
  time click you should see
</div>
<div class="info">
  opening state becomes true (meaning buffering will start) and when you click
  again
</div>
<div class="info">
  you will see the opening state becomes false and closing state becomes true
  (meaning the buffering stops)
</div>
<div class="info">
  after that immediately all the emitted values between open and close will be
  logged as an array.
</div>
<div class="info">
  You can try open buffering and wait till source completes and observe the
  logged buffered values.
