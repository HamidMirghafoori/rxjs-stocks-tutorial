  1 - combine all three observables as one observable named
  higherOrderObservable$
</div>
<div class="info">
  Because zipAll is a pipeable operator, so pipe into higherOrderObservable$ and
  apply zipAll()

<div class="info">then subscribe and log the values.</div>
<div class="info">
  Note similar to zip, the moment one observable completes, zipAll completes
  too.

<div class="info">
  2 - copy your higherOrderObservable$ code and provide resultSelector function
  to zipAll()
</div>
<div class="info">
  to transform data same as zip() transformation with a dash between values
