<div class="title">bufferToggle</div>
<div class="info">
  To understand the bufferToggle functionality we design the following:
</div>
<div class="info">1 - create source$ observable that is interval of 200ms</div>
<div class="info">
  2 - crate toggle$ observable which is basically an event from click on
  document
</div>
<div class="info">
  3 - create openings$ observable which uses toggles$ signal to increment
  clickCounts and applies filter()
</div>
<div class="info indent">
  to filter clicks when clickCount is odd. You can add a log for debugging like:
</div>
<div class="info indent">
  ('opening = ', ***) *** is the return value from filter()
</div>
<div class="info">
  4 - Use source$ observable to take 50 signals, use tap to log the value of
  signal, then apply bufferToggle
</div>
<div class="info">
  first argument will be openings$ and second will be a function which filters
  toggle$ when clickCount is even
</div>
<div class="info">you can log closing state same as opening.</div>
<div class="info">
  By subscribing to source$ you should see logs of source$ and when you first
  time click you should see
</div>
<div class="info">
  opening state becomes true (meaning buffering will start) and when you click
  again
</div>
<div class="info">
  you will see the opening state becomes false and closing state becomes true
  (meaning the buffering stops)
</div>
<div class="info">
  after that immediately all the emitted values between open and close will be
  logged as an array.
</div>
<div class="info">
  You can try open buffering and wait till source completes and observe the
  logged buffered values.
