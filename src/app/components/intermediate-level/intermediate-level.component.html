<div class="info">
  To demonstrate bufferTime() functionality we will create 3 observables as
  following:
</div>
<div class="info">
  interval of 200 which will pipe into bufferTime to buffer 800ms emits and
  takes 4 buffers
</div>
<div class="info">and finally logs the observable has been completed</div>
<div class="info">
  the 2nd observable will have same structure only buffering 600 and interval of
  1200
</div>
<div class="info">
  the 3rd observable will have same structure only buffering 600 and interval of
  1200 and maxBufferSize 3
</div>
<div class="info">
  Note how buffer window causes some emits discarded and how maxBufferSize
  limits the emission length
