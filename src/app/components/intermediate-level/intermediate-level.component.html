<div class="title">timeout</div>
<div class="info">This is simple task, we want to create an observable that emits 'Hello' and then waits for a long time</div>
<div class="info">Using timeout() we throw an error and message the timeout error so this way we could complete the observable</div>
<div class="info">Note that because we applied the logic for the first emission thus we won't see Hello logged. to fix that we need to use different approach.</div>
