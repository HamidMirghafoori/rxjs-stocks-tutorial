<div class="title">Question 1: Multi-casting</div>
<div class="info">We want to create a subject named multiCaster$ and three subscribers with full signature which</div>
<div class="info">each has identifiable log to relate log to the subscription.</div>
<div class="info">Every time we emit new value we like to see subscribers logged the value</div>
<div class="info">Steps to take: create 1st subscriber then emit value 5</div>
<div class="info">create 2nd subscriber and emit value 22</div>
<div class="info">create 3rd subscriber and emit value 7</div>
<div class="info">Complete the subject and emit value 100 and observe what happens.</div>
<div class="title">Note that:</div>
<div class="info">After the subject is completed, calling next() (or error()) will not have any effect.</div>
<div class="info">The observable is terminated, and further emissions are ignored.</div>
<div class="info">This is part of the RxJS specification: once an observable completes,</div>
<div class="info">it is in a "final state" and cannot emit more values or errors.</div>
